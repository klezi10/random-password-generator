## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate 4 random passwords at once by clicking a button
- 1-click copy password to clipboard

- Update: Added the option for the user to choose how many characters they want to generate for the passwords with restrictions between 8 and 18 characters.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

Coded from the Figma design provided by Scrimba.

### What I learned

I learned how to pull four different arrays into one and how to display four different array items in the DOM. I also learned how to set up 1-click copy to clipboard.

### Continued development

I would like to replace the repetitive inputs in the HTML with displaying the code in the DOM from JavaScript on window load without using innerHTML.
